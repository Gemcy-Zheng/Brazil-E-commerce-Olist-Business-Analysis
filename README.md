· From 7 AM to 10 AM, there is a sharp increase, while the order quantity remains relatively stable from 10 AM to 22 PM. Except for the sleeping hours (23-7), the customer flow is relatively stable during other times. Therefore, platform customer service personnel should maintain consistent service hours with customers.

· On the 24th of the month, the sales total accounted for 15% of the entire month of November.
Which state had the highest transaction amount and order quantity on November 24? The transaction amount and order quantity on November 24 primarily came from the state of SP (São Paulo), followed by MG (Minas Gerais) and RJ (Rio de Janeiro). The top-selling categories were "cama_mesa_banho" (bed_bath_table), "moveis_decoracao" (furniture_decor), and "ferramentas_jardim" (garden_tools). There were more purchases in the decoration category. According to surveys, the Christmas holiday is coming in December, so it can be inferred that these products are mainly purchased for home decoration. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct regular promotions, in addition to Black Friday.

#### Analysis
The chart shows a comprehensive view of customer reviews, totaling 100,000 with an average score of 4.07 out of a maximum of 5.

Additionally, 19,000 customers rated the service 4 stars, while only 3,235 gave it the least frequent rating of 2 stars. However, there is a significant number of 1-star ratings, totaling 12,000, which indicates areas where the service could be improved.

#### Market Insights
The overall high average rating and a large number of 5-star ratings are strong indicators of customer satisfaction. However, the presence of a considerable number of low ratings suggests that there are areas in need of improvement.

#### Recommendations
To maintain these high levels of satisfaction and address the existing concerns, Olist could explore the underlying issues behind the low ratings and implement targeted customer service improvements. Capitalizing on the aspects that are leading to 4 and 5-star ratings through customer testimonials or case studies can further boost the company's reputation.

### Sub-part 7.2: Return & Review 2

#### Analysis
The categories with the most returns and cancellations are 'bed_bath_table' and 'health_beauty'. As for the order status, 97% are successfully delivered, while 1.11% are canceled. The average ratings can also be viewed by year and month, with January 2017 seeing the highest average ratings. Additionally, ratings can be broken down by region.

#### Market Insights
The high frequency of returns and cancellations in specific categories like 'bed_bath_table' and 'health_beauty' could indicate quality issues or perhaps unmet customer expectations in these areas. The overwhelmingly high delivery rate is a positive sign, but the cancellations, although minimal, should not be ignored. The fluctuation in average ratings over time and across regions could provide insights into varying levels of customer satisfaction.

#### Recommendations
- Investigate the reasons behind the high return and cancellation rates in specific categories.
- Strengthen quality control measures in these categories to reduce returns and cancellations.
- Examine the trends in average ratings by year, month, and region to identify any patterns or areas for improvement.
- Implement targeted customer engagement strategies based on these insights, which could include region-specific promotions or enhanced customer service features.

### Sub-part 7.3: Cancellation

#### Analysis
The data reveals that a total of 625 orders were cancelled over the year. The number of cancellations varies by month, with the highest occurring in August (111 cancellations) and the lowest in December (11 cancellations).

#### Market Insights
The fluctuation in cancellation rates could indicate varying customer satisfaction levels throughout the year. The peak in August might suggest issues related to supply chain, demand forecasting, or customer service that need to be addressed.

#### Recommendations
- Conduct a deeper analysis to identify the reasons behind high cancellation rates in specific months, especially August.
- Implement proactive customer service measures, such as sending order status updates to customers and offering quicker response times to inquiries.
- Review and possibly optimize the supply chain to ensure that product availability matches demand, thus reducing the need for cancellations.
- Consider introducing a more flexible return policy to convert potential cancellations into returns, which may be less detrimental to overall sales.

### Sub-part 7.4: Cancellation Rating

#### Analysis
Out of 625 cancelled orders, 620 received ratings. A majority of these ratings were negative, with 432 (69.68%) customers giving a rating of 1. On the other hand, 70 customers (11%) gave a 5-star rating.

#### Market Insights
The high number of 1-star ratings indicates significant customer dissatisfaction related to cancellations. Most of the low ratings are attributed to issues like damaged or faulty items. Conversely, the existence of 5-star ratings may suggest that Olist is doing well in managing returns, leading to some level of customer satisfaction.

#### Recommendations
- Investigate the common reasons behind the 1-star ratings, especially focusing on comments that mention "broken," "bad," "damaged," or "faulty" products.
- Enhance quality control measures to reduce the likelihood of sending damaged or faulty items.
- Continue to excel in return management, as indicated by the 5-star ratings, to maintain this area of customer satisfaction.

#### Market Insights
